# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



1. Clone or Download the Repository:
    If you have the project repository URL, clone it using Git:
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git

Otherwise, download the project files as a ZIP archive and extract them.

Install Dependencies:

Navigate to the project directory and run:
        
        npm install

Start the Development Server:
Run the following command in your terminal to launch the development server:

        npm run dev

        This will start the server, usually accessible at http://localhost:3000/ by default (the exact port may vary).
